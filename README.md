# kubernetes-workshop

An introduction into Kubernetes and Service Meshs.

## 1 Branches

The repository splits up into different branches depending on your current progress.

| Task | Branch        | Description                                           |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | master        | Initial skeleton project                              |
| 1    | task1/final   | Implements a monolith to serve all requested routes   |
| 2    | task2/starter | Initial split up into services                        |
| 2    | task2/final   | Implements two services to serve all requested routes |
| 3    | task3/starter | Initial kubernetes files                              |
| 3    | task3/final   | Deploys all services to a k8s cluster                 |

## 2 Tasks

### 2.1 Create a monolith

Build a monolithic application that serves the following aspects:

1) Create new patients
2) Create new prescriptions
3) List all patient ids
4) Calculate the costs of prescriptions for a given patient

You can use the integration tests for validating your artifacts.
In order to continue with the next task more easily, you should 
create different entities for your read and write model.

The task doesn't require any database access - instead you should
persist everything in an in-memory store (hint: singleton).

The directory `patient-monolith` is the only place you need to touch 
for this task.

The following routes have to be served:

```
POST /patients {
  "firstName": "...",
  "lastName": "...",
  "age": 123
}
Returns 201 Created { "id":  "..." }

POST /perscriptions {
  "name": "...",
  "dose": "...",
  "price": 12.12
}
Returns 201 Created { "id": "..." }

GET /patients/<id>/costs

Returns 200 OK { "patientId": "...", "costs": 45.27 }
Returns 404 Not found if patient does not exist

GET /patients 

Returns 200 OK {
  "patientIds": ["id1", "id2"]
}
```

Note: Do not remove the dependency `spring-boot-starter-actuator`. 
It is used for health checks during integration tests.

Hint: How to create a rest controller

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping(value = "/myuri")
public class SomeController {
    // ....

    @PostMapping(produces = {"application/json"})
    public ResponseEntity<EntityId> createSth(@RequestBody MyEntity entity) {
        try {
            // ...

            return new ResponseEntity<>(entityId, HttpStatus.CREATED);
        } catch (SomeException e) {
            return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY);
        }
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Split into services and containerize them

Split the write and the read concern of your monolithic application into two services and 
create docker containers that are composed inside docker-compose.

Before your start, merge the branch `task2/starter` into your current branch. 
As a result, you should see the following additional artifacts:
1) insurance-service: Service that lists patientIds and calculates prescription costs
2) patient-service: Service that creates patients and prescriptions
3) docker-compose.yml: Composes a postgres database and both services 

As a first step, you should create tables for your views and 
additional materialized view which will fake eventual consistency.
For this purpose have a look into [init.sql](./patient-db/init.sql)
and add the following:

1) Patient Table
2) Prescription Table
3) Dispenses Materialized View
4) PatientIds Materialized View

Hint: You need to add triggers which update the materialized view on
table updates.

In order to solve this task, you have to implement each Dockerfile of both services.
It is important that each service is served on port `8080` - docker-compose will 
remap them to avoid conflicts.

If you have merged the starter branch, you don't have to worry about database access.
Everything is already configured in the `application.yml`:

```yaml
 jpa:
    database: postgresql
    open-in-view: false
  datasource:
    platform: postgres
    url: jdbc:postgresql://patient-database:5432/patientdb
    username: cgmuser
    password: cgmpassword
```

Hint 1: How to create an entity

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "my_entity", schema = "public")
public class MyEntity {
    @Id
    @Column(name = "id")
    private String id;

    @Column(name = "column_name")
    private String someProp;
}
```

Hint 2: How to create a Repository

```java
@Repository
public interface SomeRepo extends 
    JpaRepository<MyEntity, String>, 
    JpaSpecificationExecutor<MyEntity> 
{ ... }
```
 
### 2.3 Deploy services into k8s cluster  

Now it is time for Kubernetes ðŸ˜Ž. Get ready by executing the following scripts:
```bash
./scripts/setupKubernetes
./scripts/setupMinikube
```
After the installation was successful, you have to create your minikube cluster by running the following command:
```bash
minikube start
```
By default, not all required features, that we need for our workshop, are enabled. To change this, run the following:
```
minikube addons enable default-storageclass
minikube addons enable ingress
```

Since we are working a local environment and don't want to rely on an external docker registry, 
you have need to access the minikube's docker environment. This is done by running:
```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
``` 
You will notice new docker containers, if you run ``docker ps`` and probably recognize that your docker 
from task 2 are gone. Change this by building them again:
```
cd patient-service && docker build -t patient-service:1.0.0
cd insurance-service && docker build -t insurance-service:1.0.0
```

Before you start with the task, merge the branch ``task3/starter`` into your current one. 
It will add a new directory ``k8s``, which you will use to create your kubernetes files.

The task is as simple as that:
1) Complete all the stubbed k8s files and deploy them
2) Your ingress has to be reachable on `kubernetes-workshop.info`
3) Services should be of type cluster ip
4) Sensitive configurations like passwords should live inside a secret
5) All files that already exist as stubs have to be used and no additional ones should be created
6) Verify your result by running the integration tests

**Hint 1: Hostname**

In order to get access to this hostname, you have to update your hosts file as follows:
```
# Get your cluster ip:
minikube ip

# Add this to your hosts file (/etc/hosts)
<the ip> kubernetes-workshop.info
```

**Hint 2: path resolution**

You will face the issue, that subpath are not automatically resolved by your ingress controller.
To solve this issue, you have to use the redirect feature of ingress like in the following example:
```
# Ingress.yaml
...
    annotations:
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2

...
    - path: /some-path-to-service(/|$)(.*)
...
```
This will append any subpath to your service call.

**Hint 3: Secrets**
The value of a secret have to be encoded in base64. The following commands will en- and decode values:
```bash
# Encode in Base64
echo -n 'username' | base64
# Decode from Base64
echo -n 'dXNlcm5hbWU=' | base64 --decode
```

**Hint 4: DNS resolution**
Just like in docker-compose, you can access different nodes in the cluster by using the 
service label. Consequently, the following use case demonstrated how to access a database:

```
# DBService.yaml
....
    selector:
        ports:
          - port: 5432
        app: patient-database
...

URL to access inside the cluster: patient-database:5432
```

**Hint 5: Configmap**
Inside the k8s/patient-db directory, you will find a Configmap. This is used to initialize your
postgresql database. Use the secret for database name, username and password.


The following commands will support you during development:
```bash
# Get all deployments
kubectl get deployments
# Inspect a given deployment
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>

# Get all pods
kubectl get pods
# Inspect a given pod
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
# View logs of pod
kubectl logs -f <pod-name>

# Get all persistent volume claims
kubectl get pvc
# Inspect a given persistent volume claim
kubectl describe <pvc-name>

# Get all ingress
kubectl get ingress
# Inspect an ingress
kubectl describe ingress <ingress-name>

# Get all Services
kubectl get services
# Inspect a given service
kubectl describe service <service-name>

# Get all secrets
kubectl get secrets
# Inspect a secret
kubectl describe secret <secret-name>
# 

# Apply all k8s files of a given directory
kubectl apply -f <dir-name>

# Remove all k8s files from minikube located in a host dir
kubectl delete -f <dir-name>
```

## 3 Integration Tests

This module is already implemented and doesn't require additional changes. 
In short, it proves that your artifacts are working.

Run it with:
```bash
cd integration-tests && mvn clean verify
```

If you need to configure your tests (e.g. ports have changed or routes), 
then have a look into the following [file](./integration-tests/src/test/resources/config.yml).
It lets you change the host, port, baseUrl and health uri. These are required to run 
the integration tests successfully.
